## Technical Specifications

### Admin Dashboard Structure

The admin dashboard consists of:
1. Main dashboard with metrics and activity overview
2. User management interface
3. Group management interface
4. System settings interface
5. Activity logs view

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend Integration**: Fetch API connecting to Cloudflare Worker endpoints
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with admin-specific permissions

### Security Considerations

- Admin dashboard requires elevated permissions
- All admin actions must be properly logged
- Session timeout for admin functions
- Rate limiting for sensitive operations
- Input validation on all form fields
- CSRF protection for all actions

## Testing Plan

- Unit tests for admin-specific JavaScript functions
- Integration tests for admin APIs
- UI testing for responsive design
- Security testing for admin authorization

## Implementation Challenges

1. Secure admin-only access
2. Efficient user and group management for large datasets
3. Proper error handling and feedback
4. Maintaining consistent state across different admin views
