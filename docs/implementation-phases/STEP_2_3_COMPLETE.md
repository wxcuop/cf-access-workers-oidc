1. **Admin Dashboard Foundation**:
   - Build dashboard structure and layout
   - Implement admin authentication
   - Create responsive navigation

2. **User Management Interface**:
   - Develop user listing and search
   - Implement CRUD operations for users
   - Create group assignment interface

3. **Group Management Interface**:
   - Build group management UI
   - Implement analytics dashboard
   - Create reporting functionality

## Conclusion

The successful completion of Step 2.3 marks the full completion of Phase 2. The sign-in page is now production-ready, with verified cross-browser compatibility, accessibility compliance, and excellent performance metrics. The deployment to Cloudflare Pages ensures reliable hosting with automatic scaling and global distribution.

All acceptance criteria have been met or exceeded, and the authentication frontend is now fully integrated with the backend API endpoints implemented in Phase 1. This completes the core user-facing authentication experience, allowing focus to shift to the admin interface in Phase 3.
