# Admin Dashboard Implementation

This document details the design and implementation of the admin dashboard for the OIDC authentication system.

## Overview

The admin dashboard provides functionality for:

1. Overview of system metrics and activity
2. User management
3. Group management
4. System settings and configuration

## Implementation Status

## Technical Architecture

The admin dashboard follows a modular architecture:

- **HTML**: Semantic markup with proper accessibility features
- **CSS**: Modern styling with CSS variables for theming
- **JavaScript**: Modular JS files for specific functionality:
  - `admin-dashboard.js` - Core dashboard functionality
  - `user-management.js` - User management features
  - `group-management.js` - Group management features
  - `admin-utils.js` - Shared utility functions

## Next Steps

1. Complete core dashboard functionality
2. Implement authentication and authorization
3. Connect to backend APIs
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Implement proper loading states and UI feedback
6. Add additional metrics and analytics
7. Implement audit logging and security features

## Security Considerations

- Admin dashboard requires elevated permissions
- All admin actions must be properly logged
- Session timeout for admin functions
- Rate limiting for sensitive operations
- Input validation on all form fields
- CSRF protection for all actions
